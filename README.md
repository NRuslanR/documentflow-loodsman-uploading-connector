# documentflow-loodsman-uploading-connector
Asynchronous integration pipeline's connector for Delphi-based Document Flow System. Basically, the connector consists of three parts. First of them is document flow system's data change subscriber. This component receives the data changes from PostgreSQL database via logical replication using WAL. Second part is different converters that converts the document flow's data to requests (may say commands) for creating the corresponding Loodsman PLM system's documents and tasks (performings within document flow). Third part is messaging services that are reponsible for a sending of the requests and a receiving of the replies from Loodsman system's destination connector through intermediates such as RabbitMQ.
